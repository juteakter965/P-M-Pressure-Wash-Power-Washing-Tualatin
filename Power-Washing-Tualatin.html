                <h2>What is Power Washing and How Does It Work?</h2>

                <p>Power washing, also known as hot water pressure washing, uses heated water combined with high pressure to clean exterior surfaces. This method is particularly effective for removing stubborn stains, grease, oil, and deeply embedded dirt that cold water pressure washing alone cannot eliminate.</p>

                <h3>Power Washing vs. Pressure Washing: Understanding the Difference</h3>

                <p>While many people use these terms interchangeably, there are important distinctions:</p>

                <h3>Soft Washing: The Gentle Alternative</h3>

                <p>For delicate surfaces like roofs, painted siding, and wood, soft washing provides a safer alternative. This low-pressure method uses specialized cleaning solutions to break down organic growth without the risk of surface damage. P&M Pressure Wash offers both power washing and soft washing services to suit every surface type.</p>

                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions About Power Washing in Tualatin</h2>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How much does power washing cost in Tualatin?</h3>
                    <p>Power washing costs in Tualatin typically range from $200-$800 depending on the service. A standard house wash averages $325-$575, roof cleaning costs $300-$800, and driveway cleaning runs $100-$300. Final pricing depends on property size, surface condition, and accessibility. Contact P&M Pressure Wash at (503) 826-7996 for a free, detailed estimate tailored to your specific property.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How often should I power wash my house in Tualatin?</h3>
                    <p>Due to Tualatin's wet climate with 35-40 inches of annual rainfall, we recommend power washing your house at least once per year. Properties in heavily shaded areas or surrounded by trees may benefit from twice-yearly cleaning. Regular annual maintenance prevents deep staining, protects your siding, and maintains property value. The best time is late spring or early summer after winter rains subside.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Is power washing safe for all surfaces?</h3>
                    <p>No, not all surfaces should be cleaned with high-pressure power washing. That's why P&M Pressure Wash uses multiple cleaning methods. Soft washing (low pressure with specialized solutions) is ideal for roofs, painted surfaces, wood siding, and delicate materials. High-pressure power washing works well for concrete, brick, stone, and heavily soiled areas. We assess each surface and use the appropriate method to ensure safe, effective cleaning without damage.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What's the difference between power washing and pressure washing?</h3>
                    <p>Power washing uses heated water (up to 200°F) combined with high pressure, making it more effective for removing grease, oil, and stubborn stains. Pressure washing uses cold water at high pressure and works well for general dirt, algae, and mildew. Power washing is typically used for commercial applications and heavy-duty cleaning, while pressure washing is common for residential services. Both methods are effective when used appropriately for the surface type.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Can you power wash in winter in Tualatin?</h3>
                    <p>Yes, power washing can be performed year-round in Tualatin's mild climate. We avoid washing when temperatures drop below 40°F or during heavy rain, but winter cleaning is actually beneficial for removing mold and mildew that thrive during wet months. Many property owners prefer spring or summer cleaning, but winter services are available during dry periods. Contact us to schedule during optimal weather conditions.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Will power washing damage my landscaping?</h3>
                    <p>When performed correctly by professionals, power washing should not harm landscaping. P&M Pressure Wash takes multiple precautions: pre-wetting vegetation to dilute cleaning solutions, using plant-safe, biodegradable products, covering delicate plants when necessary, controlling water pressure and direction, and thoroughly rinsing all areas after cleaning. If you have particularly sensitive plants, notify us before service so we can take extra precautions.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Do I need to be home during power washing?</h3>
                    <p>No, you don't need to be home during service as long as we have access to the areas being cleaned and a water source. Many customers provide gate codes or leave gates unlocked and continue with their day. We'll contact you before arrival and after completion with before/after photos. However, we're happy to walk through the property with you before or after service if you prefer to be present.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How long does power washing take?</h3>
                    <p>Service time varies by project size and scope. A typical house wash takes 2-4 hours, roof cleaning requires 3-5 hours, and driveway cleaning usually takes 1-2 hours. Larger properties or those with heavy soiling may take longer. We provide estimated completion times with your quote and work efficiently to minimize disruption. Most residential projects are completed in a single day.</p>
